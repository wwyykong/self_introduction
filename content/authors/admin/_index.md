awards:
  - title: A Parallel Computation Protocol Model based on Earth Grid

    summary: |
      - Achieved to subdivide and aggregate the computing dataset to reuse the RDD (Resilient Distributed Datasets) efficiently
      - Assigned the unique identification to data on a global scale to retrieve data accurately and 20 times faster
      - Proposed a local computing scheme by which the time of broadcasting data can be saved thus improved computational efficiency by about 50%
  - title: Analysis of Parking Patterns

    summary: |
      - Filled in the research gap of parking situation in Chinese Danwei by a case study of the Information Campus of Wuhan University
      - Designed an Android App to video while recording the location information of parked cars and leveraged an OCR algorithm to identify license plates from video frames to match it with the GPS
      - Classified parking spots and cars to identify the parking patterns, and proposed management suggestions based on the findings
  - title: Interpret Population Density in Wuhan Using UAV Images and Night-time Lights
    date: '2018-10-01'
    # date_start: 2017-10-01
    # date_end: 2018-10-01
    # awarder: Coursera
    # icon: coursera
    summary: |
      - Testified the hypothesis that the panoramic images of night-time light captured by UAV (unmanned aerial vehicle) work well in estimating population density (R-square = 0.81), and the combination of multi-angular night-time remote-sensing data sources works even better (R-square = 0.93)
      - Conducted the research as a team leader by which the ability of cooperation and leadership was proved
      - Defogged UAV images to alleviate the influence of weather conditions, thus avoided collecting data repeatedly
      - Proposed reasonable variables to represent information contained in UAV image

#       Learned:
#       - Synthesize your own blockchain solutions
#       - Gain an in-depth understanding of the specific mechanics of Bitcoin
#       - Understand Bitcoin’s real-life applications and learn how to attack and destroy Bitcoin, Ethereum, smart contracts and Dapps, and alternatives to Bitcoin’s Proof-of-Work consensus algorithm
#   - title: 'Object-Oriented Programming in R'

#     awarder: datacamp
#     icon: datacamp
#     summary: |
#       Object-oriented programming (OOP) lets you specify relationships between functions and the objects that they can act on, helping you manage complexity in your code. This is an intermediate level course, providing an introduction to OOP, using the S3 and R6 systems. S3 is a great day-to-day R programming tool that simplifies some of the functions that you write. R6 is especially useful for industry-specific analyses, working with web APIs, and building GUIs.

I am interested in interdisciplinary studies, particularly those that integrate big data, artificial intelligence, and urban issues.
